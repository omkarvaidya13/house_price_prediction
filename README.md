Technical Stack: Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, Multivariable Linear Regression

Aim: To determine the price of a house in a region by taking different factors into consideration using the technique of Multivariable Linear Regression.

The dataset used for the task house price prediction is the Boston House Prices dataset. The dataset consists of 506 records with about 13 different characteristics. The different attributes are the average number of rooms per dwelling, property tax, pupil-teacher ratio, etc. The aim is to predict the price of purchasing a house in Boston based on different attributes.

In order to determine the price of houses, understanding the different factors that affect the decision is important. The project initially begins with visualizing the different attributes. Understanding the correlation between different attributes is also important to get a better idea of the dependency of different attributes on each other. The project takes a dive into exploring and visualizing the attributes.

The dataset is split in a ratio of 80:20 to form the training and testing dataset respectively. The regression model is fitted on the training data and the prediction is made on the test data.

The project plots the results of the prediction to visualize how the model performed.
